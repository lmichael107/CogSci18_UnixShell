The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive.
It has survived so long because it's a power tool
that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes.
More importantly,
it helps them combine existing programs in new ways
and automate repetitive tasks
so they aren't typing the same things over and over again.
Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools 
and scalable computing resources (including most servers and clusters).
The lessons, below, will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively. 

**For our CogSci 2018 Tutorial on 'Scalable Computing' we'll be following an abridged 
walk-through of the below Schedule (skipping "Loops" and "Finding Things" altogether), 
but you can visit this full lesson (and many others) from [Software Carpentry's full set 
of computing and programming lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) created 
and taught for researchers, by researchers.**

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the
> shell.  If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize
> the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words
> for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.
>
> If you're already comfortable manipulating files and directories, using pipes, 
> searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops
> and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson: [shell-extras](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/).
